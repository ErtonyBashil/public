In this public repository I share with my comunity some of my hands-on projects I have done a couple of year 
ranging from IOT, Machine Learning, Computer vision, Natural Language processing to state of arts in Artificial Intelligence.


### IoT project

IoT application for assessing weather-related health risks. prediction and evaluation the impact of weather 
on human health. The connected object (humidity and temperature sensor) collected weather data then sent it 
to the gateway on the cloud platform, Cloud IoT Core processed, stored and analyzed the weather data and
managed the devices (connected objects) then BigQuerry stored the data, created and executed machine learning 
models.

### Machine learning and AI approaches for network security 

ML was trained to real time detect cyberattacks, the model accurately predicted wether the traffic 
in the network is a threat or not. For phishing attacks for example, the model drew whether the URL 
is benign or malicious. A recorded traffic such as log files will be used containing information
(ID, Port, eth interface, Protocol, source, timestamp ...) necessary for classification and clustering.
